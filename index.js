    FUNCTIONS REVIEW

    The following assignment is used to brush up the fundamentals of functions.

    For the problems listed below, please accomplish the following...
        1) Write out comments for each line of code explaining what it's doing, for example...

            function func() { // Creating a new function called "func".

            }
        2) Write the functionality of the function to the best of your ability.
        3) Write the function IN THE SYNTAX YOU'RE LEAST COMFORTABLE WITH. If you hate arrow functions, answer with an arrow function, etc.

    If a question is just asking for a short answer, simply write it within the comment block.

    I'm not looking for whether you know how to answer the questions with code, I want you to dissect each line of code carefully
    while showing your logic in solving the problem.
